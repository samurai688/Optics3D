    going through and refactoring on new laptop with pycharm, converting tests to pytest
    various things need plt.show() in pycharm
    I expanded the ray-sphere intersections to be more complete, may cause issues
    the whole structure is still taking shape and probably in need of some refactors
    czerny and test still work at least

    have done (pytestifying):
      sphere intersect
      rectangle intersect
      project onto plane

    still need to do (pytestifying):
      concave mirror
      axis angle rot
      angle between

    moved a copy of general.py over cause pycharm wasn't seeing it and added some stuff, should do something about that
    one thing i added to general.py was a nice bounding box equal axis thing
    need to implement source control

    finished pytestifying, without going super deep on making new and exhaustive tests
    cool
