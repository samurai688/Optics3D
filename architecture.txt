okay, how is this whole thing going to work


what we want to have is approximately

a 3D world / domain with an index of refraction (assume 1)
the user can position "optics" in that world
    each optic may define one or more regions with different indices of refraction
    each optic may define surfaces that absorb, diffusely reflect, spectrally disperse, etc
the user can initialize light rays from a location in the world however they want
    the rays are traced until
        they reach a pre-set maximum travel distance
        they are absorbed
        they leave the world
            you could optionally have like fancy stuff where they track how much attenuation etc along a path
            and even try to have a way to build up diffuse reflections and stuff by either branching or randomness
    when a light ray encounters an optic surface
        so it transitions from one index region to a new one
        the intersection pt
        the optic surface normal
        the new state of the ray based on the nature of the interaction (it gets refracted, reflected, absorbed, etc)
the user can put detectors in the world with whatever properties






there will be a tree of classes for various 2d and 3d geometry primitive shapes

there will be a tree of classes for different optics

there will be a ray class

there will be a detector class
